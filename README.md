# Sim-To-SIEM

Project Overview

Sim-To-SIEM simulates events with context of previous event codes and machines for multiple users through Tines automation. Events are then parsed into a JSON object with optimal data sizing through Cribl Cloud. Resulting telemetry is ingested into Splunk and visualized in an executive level dashboard that surfaces high level security metrics and operational insights. The dashboard is architected for multi tenant reusability.
